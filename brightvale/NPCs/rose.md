# Rose
The Doppelganger who’s blighted Brightvale.

She lives in the ruins of the old watchtower and goes prowling at night, sometimes even posing as Lump’s assistant, Jeffrey. She managed to turn one of the trees in the Lantern Marsh and further spread the blight. Rose's patron is Bhaal, who she made a pact with to save her own life. Maintains a Major Illusion spell on the watchtower.

Her ancestors worked with a few other eldritch races to create one node in a network of warp gates. In the last few centuries, however, they were displaced by the smelly humans who used their old magic site to relieve them of the shits and wipe the mud off their boots. She’s here for revenge, trying to drive out the villagers (either by haunting, destroying private property, or other means) but under the radar, so as not to attract the attention of mercs from Saintsbridge.

Rose lives to survive. It's all she's known.
