# Lump
The cheerful gnome bartender. Used to be a civil engineer; has a dark past involving a bridge collapse in Saintsbridge. Doesn't like to perform, instead prefers to use her skills to heal drunken patrons or surreptitiously calmm them down. 

Lump has short-cropped hair and a pensive yet open expression. She's chaotic good.

Her idle state is polishing/cleaning a cup with a worn dishcloth.
