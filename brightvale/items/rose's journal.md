# Rose's Journal
Day 0: Arrived in Brightvale on foot. Lost the guards by Saintsbridge. This village is a ghost of its former self.

Day 2: Notes on the “fairy circles” complete. This is certainly the site. Layout and markings on the stones clearly indicate previous doppelganger activity.

Day 3: Began posing as one of the villagers and working as an assistant in the Thirsty Fool. Villagers seem rooted, reluctant to leave town.

Day 6: Noticed a small will-o-wisp population in the Lantern Marsh. Careful cultivation could yield great results.

Day 15: Began experimenting on will-o-wisp population. Also: noticed a tree struck by lightning in the middle of the marsh. Could be a potential source of blight for swamp expansion.

Day 20: Finished setting up camp and illusion spell on the watchtower south of town. Set up mimics in the area to keep villagers away.

Day 72: Rituals complete. Turned the tree in the Lantern Marsh. Previous experiments paid off. Town population steady.

Day 75: Will-o-wisp population increasing to almost twofold, as expected.

Day 76: Noticed some townspeople around tower. Mimics kept them away for the most part.

Day 80: Illusion spell on watchtower is fading. Renew before Thursday night; revise upper levels to be more familiar.
