# Rose's Notes
Rose carries this small, leather-bound booklet about her person at all times. Some notes are hastily scrawled and crossed out. Others are neater, with accompanying diagrams.

### Gate Notes
- dilapidated gate confirmed in Brightvale, rumors somewhere in Saintsbridge, Kingsreach?
- still unsure what happens if only one is opened

### Ritual Visions
1. Beetroot from a farm with an uprooted sapling
2. Blood from a rock
3. A lumpy club
4. Storm-forged wood
5. A rose's thorn
