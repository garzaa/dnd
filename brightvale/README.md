# Brightvale
_Population: 700_

Brightvale has seen better days. It used to be a verdant farming town with a tourist attraction, but the wind from the north has stopped blowing and the Lantern Marsh is getting closer and closer to the southern farmlands. Harvests are waning and people are very slowly leaving.

The church was abandoned when the marsh started creeping north, and not long after that the first idiot to go wandering at night was lost to the fog and the will-o'-wisps.
Lately, there have been some odd happenings. Not odd enough to draw the militia or mercenaries from the cities to the south, but they're making people uneasy. 

It's all been rumors so far. Some say they've seen a barrel snap up a bird that landed on it, or a rock get up and walk into the forest. A couple others swear they've seen someone in the woods, someone who looks like their friend but moves...strangely.

## First Encounter
After introductions, the bartender (Rose, disguised as Lump) sets a tray of drinks on the table. One or more of them is a baby mimic, and it attacks whoever takes a drink. See encounter Baby Mimic Fight.
