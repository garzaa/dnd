# The Abandoned Church
A decrepit church, long lost to the swamps and the forest.

There is a broken window halfway up the belltower. On the ground below it lies a skeleton wearing the Ring of Defenestration.

The graveyard is small, so only a few wealthy merchants were buried in it. There are a few mimics there in the shape of the new unmarked tombstones. There are also some rings and trinkets in the graves that people can loot if they so desire.

A trapdoor behind the altar leads down to the church catacombs, which contain torches, the mimic nest, and an ancient fountain with a corroded yet still recognizable (on a DC 15 Arcana check) statue of The Dark One in its center. The stone statue is rough to the touch, and draws blood upon failing a DC 10 CON check.
