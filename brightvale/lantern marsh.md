# The Lantern Marsh
The marshes are fog-covered by day and dangerous by night, because that's when the will-o'-wisps come out. The party needs to go past the marshes to get to the abandoned church.

In the center of the marsh lurks the source of the blight: an Awakened Tree, turned by the doppelganger that lives in the watchtower.
