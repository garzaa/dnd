# The Old Watchtower
The ruined watchtower on the disused southwestern road. 

The watchtower is not quite as decayed as it looks, but none of the villagers are willing to get close enough to find out. It's the site of a Major Image spell, refreshed periodically by Rose to hide her lair. 

The will-o-wisp research station on the second floor contains the Entangled Wisps item.
