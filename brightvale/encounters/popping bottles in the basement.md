# Popping Bottles in the Basement

The cellar is dark and unlit. In the far corner lies the unconscious Lump (with a smaller, more powerful lump on her head) on some old straw. She explains that Jeffrey, her unpaid intern assistant, must hae knocked her unconscious when he brought her down to the basement to show her something earlier in the evening.

One or two cask-shaped mimics lurk in the corner, and will attack if inspected. If the party turns to go back up the stairs, one of them will fall off its braces with a large _THUD_.
