# Rose's Catacomb Ambush

While the PCs are in the church catacombs, Rose extinguishes the torches with Prestidigitation, casts Darkness (cancels out most passive dark vision perks), and steps out from behind on of the pillars. When the lights come back on, there are two versions of a PC. They play both versions of themselves while the DM knows which one is real. Refer to Polymorph for spell details and resolving conflicts and checks.

On identification, Rose initiates combat. She will try to stop the fight at half health or lower, at which point the PCs can interrogate her about her motivations.
