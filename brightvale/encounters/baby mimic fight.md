# Baby Mimic Fight
Rose, disguised as Lump the bartender, sets down a tray of drinks and heads back behind the bar. One or more of the drinks is a baby mimic, and chaos erupts as soon as it attacks whoever picked it up. The rest of the tavern is similarly outraged and demands answers from the bartender. 

Rose will do everything she can to keep the party from getting behind the bar, but on a successful CHA check she will point the party towards the delivery cart in the alley and then flee while the players are outside. Whether there's actually a delivery cart in the alley is up to the DM.

If the group enters the cellar, refer to Popping Bottles in the Basement.
