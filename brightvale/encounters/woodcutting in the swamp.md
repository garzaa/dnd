# Woodcutting in the Swamp
The turned tree is surrounded by will-o-wisps and will try to hit the PCs with branches. It's possessed by a shard of The Dark One and is weak to fire. On defeat, it will burn up and explode in a Fireball centered on the tree.

Unless the tree takes Radiant damage or is contained by other means, the shard will exit the tree and disappear in the direction of the Old Church, where it will possess the statue of The Dark One and cause it to spew blood. Permanently.

If Rose is with the party, she visibly grimaces in pain. If her warlock status isn't yet revealed, she will try to cover it up, pretending it's an old (read: human-inflicted) wound in a ploy to guilt the party.
