# The Fairy Circle

An ancient stone circle in the woods north of town. Brightvale used to be known for the healing powers of the last remaining arch, and travelers passing through to the mountains would rest for a while and walk through it to rejuvenate themselves and purify the food and water in their packs.

The stones started to lose what remaining potency they had around the same time the marshes started growing. These days, the farmers are lucky if they can disinfect a few ounces of water a couple times a day.

The players must solve some kind of puzzle to get the intricate rituals set up and the gate open. Maybe Rose will renounce the demon gate or something. It doesn't have to be a demon gate either...who knows
