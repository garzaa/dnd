# The Thirsty Fool
A two-story timber and brick building, with several leaded glass windows and a large cellar. There are a few beds in a common room upstairs.

Lump, the local bartender, runs it. She is a level 2 bard.

Has a basement attached to the kitchen, which can be accessed from a door behind the counter.

Behind the building is a large, boarded-up hole that leads to the cellar. Mimic tracks emerge from the forest, cross the road, and lead to the hole.
