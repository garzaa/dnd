# The Blight of Brightvale

In classic D&D style, the party meets in a run-down inn: The Thirsty Fool. It has a weathered portrait of a grinning one-eyed clown above the door, and it's located in the small town of Brightvale.

The party has been chasing vague rumors about a doppelganger haunting the countryside. They arrived in the middle of the day and have spent the afternoon gathering details about the town. It's now evening, and travelers are cautioned from venturing outside the town at night, especially since it's a full moon.
