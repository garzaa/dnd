# Road Encounters


## Attack of the Charismatic Bandits
The group is waylaid by a gang of bandits. Their leader stands in the middle of the road, his cloak billowing impressively behind him.

He says he's never seen such a beautiful group of adventurers, and tries to convince the party to give him something to remember them by. DC 15 CHA save for everybody.

He carries the Cloak of Billowing item and can be persuaded (with violence or otherwise) to part with it.
