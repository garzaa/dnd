A two-story stone building, with several stained-glass windows and dwarven deco-inspired wrought iron furnishings. Several town guards are always lurking inside, wandering around the shop and poking the items on display.

Mann sells a variety of simple and martial weapons, and can forge things on request if he has the time and money.

Prices are a bit inflated, because he makes next to no money off selling weapons to the city guard.
