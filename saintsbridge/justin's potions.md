# Justin's Potions
An apothecary in Saintsbridge, run by one Justin Kuritzkes and his hapless assistant.

Justin carries a large variety of odd ingredients, and is always eager to try to remove curses on things the occasional drifters bring in. Unfortunately, adding curses is easier than removing them, and there are always a few cursed items lying around his shop.

Justin is terrible at bookkeeping, and seems to only remain in business due to the favor of the Lord Mayor.
