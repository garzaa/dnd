# Mann (the Tired)
The main blacksmith of Saintsbridge. Studied smithing with a town of dwarves in the mountains and can make masterwork weapons if the players have the coin. Has no patience for haggling mercenaries.

Every day, he questions what went wrong to make him end up in a city on the plains repairing guards' breastplates and churning out nearly-dull swords.
