# The Lord Mayor
_His Dutifulness, James the Perceptive_

The Lord Mayor of Saintsbridge. Previously worked in the Saintsbridge Guard.

A level 7 Warlock with extremely high CHA, whose patron is none other than The Dark One. Made a pact with him to ascend to power over Saintsbridge (and eventually the continent) but put out a bounty on Rose's head when he learned she was competing with him. The Dark One, being the god of murder, is delighted.

He is in league with the local archbishop and they will occasionally perform intricate rituals in the catacombs below the cathedral.
