# Eastern Gates
The eastern gates of Saintsbridge lie at the end of a long road through the plains, flanked by watchtowers and manned by bored guards. Behind them, the city sprawls in a haze of dust and chimney smoke. There's a river in there somewhere, but you couldn't tell from the outside.

The gate guards carry maps full of tourist-trap-ish locations in order to make some coin off the religious peasants who come to Saintsbridge on a pilgrimage to the cathedral.
